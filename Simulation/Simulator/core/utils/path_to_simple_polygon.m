%  PATH_TO_SIMPLE_POLYGON    generates a simple polygon around path with 
%  some input width.
% 
%  This function works only in 2D.
% 
%  If the path is self-intersecting or path is close enough to 
%  self-intersection then resulting polygon is not guaranteed to be simple,
%  i.e. it may be self-intersecting. Some of these cases are detected in
%  this function but not all of them.
% 
%  Usage
%    polygon = PATH_TO_SIMPLE_POLYGON(path, width);
% 
%  Parameters
%    path        (2, n)      Sequence of 2D points representing the path.
%    width       (1, 1)      Width of polygon perpendicular to the path.
% 
%  Returns
%    polygon     (2, 2n)     Vertices of polygon representing inflated path.
