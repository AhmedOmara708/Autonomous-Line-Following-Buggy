%  KINEMATICS_POSE_ESTIMATION    computes the robot new pose using its
%  kinematics model.
%  
%  Robot can have any wheel configuration, and it is assmued moving in 2D
%  world (ramps are not supported).
% 
%  Not all wheels contribute to this kinematics model! If the following
%  conditions apply then the wheel affects the model:
%    - wheel is driven by a DC-motor. Compounded motor configuration, e.g.
%      DC motor connected to another DC motor in series is not considered.
%      Only the immediate parent controls the wheel angular velocity. Such
%      wheel is called active_wheel.
%    - wheel must have the normal vector to its plane perpendicular to the
%      world z-axis, that is, wheel must have vertical contact with the
%      world xy-plane. This condition might change over time especially when
%      the drive motor is steered by another motor. 
% 
%  Notes: 
%    - Other motors (DC or servo) can be connected to the drive DC-motor but
%      they must be used for steering only, i.e. they rotate the drive motor
%      around the world z-axis.
%    - The z-position of the wheel is ignored, i.e. it's assumed all valid
%      wheels are in contact with the world xy-plane.
% 
%  This function uses robot object to ONLY extract wheel initial properties 
%  and transfromations with respect to the robot local frame. Other robot
%  properties, such as transformation or motor velocities, are not used to
%  compute the new pose. This is because it's possible to use this function
%  for dead reckoning localization where such class keeps track of its own
%  representation of pose. Moreover, when physical/real robot is used
%  `robot.transformation` is not necessarily updated, and wheel velocity is
%  measured using encoder, if available.
% 
%  Usage
%    [pose_new, Dp_p, Dp_w, omegas_rhr] = ...
%        KINEMATICS_POSE_ESTIMATION(robot, pose_old, d_t, omegas_map);
% 
%  Parameters
%    robot    	(1, 1)  RobotClass object.
%    pose_old	(3, k)  Robot old pose in 2D world (x, y, th) with respect
%                        to  world reference frame. k is the number of poses
%                        to update.
%    d_t         (1, 1)  Time step at which wheel angular velocities are
%                        assumed constant.
%    omegas_map	(1, 1)  containers.Map object (hash table) with keys
%                        storing either wheel index or wheel label, and
%                        values storing angular velocities. The rotation 
%                        convension of each wheel is determined from robot
%                        object and defined in the robot JSON-file. This map
%                        does not have to include all active wheels. Missing
%                        wheels are assigned 0 angular velocities.
% 
%  Returns
%    pose_new    (3, k)      Robot new pose in 2D world (x, y, th) with
%                            resepect to  world reference frame.
%    Dp_p        (3, 3, k)   Jacobian of pose_new wrt pose_old (x, y, th).
%    Dp_w        (3, n, k)   Jacobian of pose_new wrt robot_velocities
%                            (v_x, v_y, w), where n is the number of valid
%                            active wheels.
%    omegas_rhr  (n, 1)      Angular velocities of all valid active wheels
%                            (even those that are not in omegas_map) in rhr
%                            rotation convension. This output is congruent
%                            with Dp_w in terms of entries order (this order
%                            is not present in omegas_map becuase it's a
%                            hash table), and both are needed to compute the
%                            motion additive noise covariance in
%                            localization.
