# Autonomous-Line-Following-Buggy
The full design of an autonomous line following buggy to navigate a track with a slope. The challenge was to control the robot to navigate the track accurately, maintaining a constant speed in all conditions, turning autonomous at the end of the track, initiating a u turn to the start and then come to a stop when reached the start position. Solidworks CAD and Altium CAD were used to model the system, and MATLAB simulations were undergone to test the system, from which the buggy was coded via arduino and run
